## Supervised learning

given data set and already know  what the correct output looks like. 

#### Regression

- try to predict results within a continuous output.

#### Classification

- predict results in a discrete output format.

- map inputs into discrete categories. 



## Unsupervised learning

- approach problems without knowing what the results would look like. 

- derive relationship from clusters 

- use when there is no feedback based on prediction results. 

## Cost function

- aka "Suqared error function" and "Mean squared error"

- measures the accuracy of out hypothesis function 

- takes an average difference
